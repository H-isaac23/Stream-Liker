# Stream-Liker
A website version of my project Youtube-Stream-Liker.

## Status
Successfully deployed to heroku. Will update the UI in the future cause it looks bad. So bad in fact that I wanna delete this website. But I use it virtually everyday I can, and it works perfectly, so that's fine I guess.

## Goal
LEARN HOW TO FREAKING USE DOCKER AND POSTGRES

## Other stuff
Will update later on, I wanna get on the code right away.
